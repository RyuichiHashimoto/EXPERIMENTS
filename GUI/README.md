A Breafly explanation
======================

    This project is roughly consisted of four parts. Each of the parts is explained as follows
    1. GUI part
        This is for the user to simply perform multiple experiments. At first, you make the file(s) which explain the parameters of the experiments. Next, you add the file to the GUI. Finally, you press a "run" bottun. All you need to perform experiments is only this. we will implement some additional functions for usuful use.

    2. EXPERIMENTS PART
        Explanations are coming soon.

    3. NETWORK PART
        Explanations are coming soon.

    4. PARALLEL COMPUTING PART.
        Explanations are coming soon.

    
    As you may know, this project has only just begun. So please wait to finish this program.
